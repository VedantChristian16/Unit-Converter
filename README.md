# Unit-Converter

This is the code to a unit converter I have engineered using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It allows the user to convert from
one unit of measurement to another within the same system. 

There are nine systems incorporated into this website. These include: Area, Currency, Data, Length, Speed, Temperature,
Time, Volume and Weight.

I have programmed the website in such a way that it only needs to be loaded once by the user and does not require any
additional Wi-Fi connection after the initial load.

I have designed it to accomodate users without a keyboard by including a number pad on the screen. A user without a mouse
may also be able to use the website given they have a touchscreen.
